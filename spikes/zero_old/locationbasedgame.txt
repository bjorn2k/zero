[Location based game]
- Maffia style or warfare style.
- Single player mode with bots (maybe only for testing without phone uplink)
- No map needed I think.
- Setup game at home. This means place <items> in world using google maps or something similar. These items have lon/lat location.
- Items can be things like guns, grenades, health, tactical information.
- Walking through the real world shows information on enemies location.
- Idea for weapon good be freeze enemy. Which means enemy may not move anymore (can not be implemented using gps location).
- Capture the flag could be coole.
- Pulse means send pulse around. For scanning 30 meters around for enemy (could be done when hearing enemy in real world).

*Combat mode
- After pulse one detects enemy. You have a advantage.
- Heaving minigun instead of pistol is advantage.
- Armor is advantage.
- Health is advantage.

*items/scenery
- weapons
- weaponshop
- health
- foodshop
- tactical information
- pulse ability
- armor

*Styles
- This location only, not deployable. Don't know if it is a good idea.
- Predefined levels with story-line, items are predefined and can be deployed in real world using google maps or similar.
